## About This Website

This personal website replicates the look and feel of classic Mac OS System 7 (early 1990s). The site loads directly into a Finder-style desktop environment where visitors interact with folders, windows, and files to explore content.

### How It Was Built

This entire site was built in a single session with Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI coding assistant). Aaron wrote a detailed ~1000-line product spec describing the Classic Mac OS aesthetic, window behavior, menu bar, games, and a HyperCard-inspired blog system. Claude translated that spec into working React components.

The process was collaborative: Aaron provided screenshots and feedback, Claude diagnosed and fixed issues in real-time. The whole thing took a few hours.

### Technical Stack

- React for component architecture
- Vite for builds
- Pure CSS (no UI libraries) for authenticity
- Canvas API for Brick Breaker game
- Deployed on Vercel

### Features

1. **Desktop Environment**: Authentic System 7 UI with platinum gray appearance, working windows (drag, resize, close, zoom), icon selection with classic inverted highlight, and global menu bar that changes based on active application.

2. **Content**: About Me section with bio, photo, and downloadable résumé. Portfolio with project case studies. External links to GitHub and LinkedIn.

3. **Games**: Fully playable Brick Breaker (Breakout clone) and Minesweeper.

4. **Blog**: HyperCard-style stack with card-based navigation, inspired by Apple's revolutionary HyperCard from 1987.

## Summary

Aaron Batchelder is a product leader who builds things. This website demonstrates his approach: write a detailed spec, collaborate with tools (in this case, AI), iterate on feedback, and ship. The retro Mac aesthetic isn't just nostalgia—it represents a time when computers felt like tools for creativity rather than portals to endless content feeds.
